# India's Air Quality EDA and Ensemble Forecasting

In this notebook, I will perform cleaning (preprocessing), exploratory analysis, and ensemble method
forecasting on the dataset files. The focus will be on per-state analytics and predictions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains comprehensive air quality data spanning from the year 2010 to
2023 for 453 cities across India. This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the air quality
conditions in various Indian cities, covering a wide geographical distribution and a substantial time
period. The data has been sourced from the Central Control Room for Air Quality Management, making
it a reliable and authoritative source of information.

### Dataset Characteristics

- **Time Period**: The dataset covers a span of 13 years, from 2010 to 2023, allowing for the analysis of
long-term air quality trends.
- **Geographic Scope**: It encompasses 453 cities, representing various regions of India and providing a
diverse set of air quality conditions.
- **Parameters**: The dataset likely includes key air quality parameters such as PM2.5 (particulate matter
2.5 micrometers or smaller), PM10, NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), CO (carbon monoxide),
O3 (ozone), and meteorological factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- **Data Collection and Reliability**: The dataset is compiled from the official portal of the Government of
India, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The CPCB is responsible for monitoring and
controlling pollution, making the data collected from this source credible and trustworthy. The data collection process utilized Selenium, a web automation tool, for extracting and processing data from the
CPCB website. This approach ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data.

## Use Case and Objectives

The dataset holds significant value for a variety of stakeholders and use cases:

- **Researchers**: Researchers can leverage this dataset to conduct in-depth analyses of air quality trends,
identify pollution patterns, and explore correlations between pollutants and meteorological conditions. The long-term nature of the dataset allows for the study of temporal trends and the assessment of the effectiveness of pollution control measures.
- **Policymakers**: Policymakers can utilize this dataset to make informed decisions regarding air quality
management. The insights gained from the dataset can guide the formulation of effective policies and strategies aimed at reducing air pollution and its adverse impacts on public health.
- **General Public**: The dataset can raise public awareness about air quality issues, helping citizens
understand pollution levels in their cities and encouraging proactive actions to mitigate pollution. Accessible visualizations and insights generated from the dataset can empower individuals to take measures to protect their health.
- **Predictive Modeling**: The dataset is suitable for developing predictive models that can forecast air
quality levels based on historical data and meteorological conditions. Such models can assist in early warnings, enabling people to prepare for periods of poor air quality.
- **Public Health Professionals**: Public health experts can use this dataset to assess the potential health risks associated with different air quality levels. This can aid in developing strategies to protect vulnerable populations during periods of high pollution.

## Results and Insights

- **EDA Insights**: The EDA phase will provide valuable insights into the air quality trends and patterns across different states in India. It may reveal high-pollution periods, correlations between pollutants and meteorological factors, and the impact of seasonality on air quality.
- **Ensemble Forecasting Insights**: The ensemble forecasting model will provide accurate predictions of air quality based on historical data and selected features. The evaluation metrics will quantify the model's performance in terms of prediction accuracy.
